# **🌬️ 2D Physics Simulation: Wind-Driven Motion**  

This **interactive physics simulation** models the motion of **floating spheres** affected by a **dynamic wind force**. Designed using **Pygame**, it visually demonstrates how objects of different **masses and sizes** respond to varying **external forces**, making it both an engaging visual experiment and a **physics learning tool**.

## **✨ Features**
✅ **Realistic Wind Force Simulation** – Wind increases, peaks, and decreases over time.  
✅ **Mass-Dependent Acceleration** – Each object reacts uniquely based on **Newton’s Second Law** (*F = m * a*).  
✅ **Smooth Motion Updates** – Frame rate–independent updates ensure **natural movement**.  
✅ **Customizable Wind Patterns** – Modify wind schedules for **different force profiles**.  
✅ **Minimalist Visuals** – Clean interface with **real-time wind force display**.

## **🎮 How It Works**
- **Three circles** (representing objects of different masses) are placed at the bottom of the screen.  
- A **wind force** is applied at regular intervals, **gradually increasing** before **tapering off**.  
- Each circle’s **acceleration is computed** based on its mass: **lighter objects move faster** under the same force.  
- The **simulation ends** once the wind cycle completes.
